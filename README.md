### Course name : Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program

### Project Title : Exploring bike-sharing data in selected cities in the United States

### Description
The Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program offers you the opportunity to learn the most important programming languages used by data scientists today. Get your start into the fascinating field of data science and learn Python, SQL, terminal, and git with the help of experienced instructors

The Body : In this project, we used Python to explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York, and Washington. We wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. We also wrote a script that takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. most common month most common day of week most common hour of day most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station) total travel time average travel time counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for New York City and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used : Chicago.csv, New_york_city.csv, Washington.csv
